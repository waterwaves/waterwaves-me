I was not surprised by the larger numbers than I guessed; instead, I did admire them because the time hasn't suppressed their personalities, and their value. I always worry my dream not being able to come true, which, in fact, verifies I am afraid of time. However, after the trivial conversation, I gained quite a little confidence."},
