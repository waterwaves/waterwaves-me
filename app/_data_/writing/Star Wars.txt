Star Wars

Last weekend, some of my friends joined me watching the most famous and 'meaningful' American movie - Star Wars IV.

Indeed, every time asked about Star Wars, I was able to surprise my friends I have never seen the movies before. Finally, I could not refuse their repeating requests to watch them, so that I decided to attempt it. I, myself, am not a sci-fi fan. Moreover, when I heard of Star Wars being made in 70s last century, I had lost 99 percent of my interest already.

The movie we watched is re-made in 90s, the quality of the movie is close to nowadays movies. I have experienced what people around me talking about everyday: Obi-Wan Kenobi and 'his' lightsaber fight, C-3PO and R2D2's funny conversations and the galaxy. After we finished the movie, I had thousands of questions to ask: why everyone understand English and human cannot understand other languages; why human can live in other planets, also trees; how gravity in the Death Star works... I also wanted to laugh when I found out the universe scenes look like the video game. Meanwhile, I admired the digital imaging technology at that time.

All in all, Star Wars is a good-plot movie, which I did enjoy a lot. However, I do need more courage and company from my friends to move forward to the next one. Anyway, I expect the chance to watch the next Star Wars movie, kind of.
